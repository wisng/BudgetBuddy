# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

1. Make sure you're in the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

3. Run a specific test file:
```bash
npm test src/tests/YourTestFile.test.js
```

Test files are located in:
- `src/tests/components/` for component tests
- `src/tests/` for screen tests
